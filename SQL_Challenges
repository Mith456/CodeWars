### 1) Given a table of random numbers as follows:

numbers table schema

id
number1
number2
Your job is to return table with similar structure and headings, where if the sum of a column is odd, the column shows the minimum value for that column, and when the sum is even, it shows the max value. You must use a case statement.

output table schema

number1
number2

SOLUTION:

SELECT 
CASE WHEN SUM(number1)%2=1 THEN min(number1) ELSE max(number1) end as number1,
CASE WHEN SUM(number2)%2=1 THEN min(number2) ELSE max(number2) end as number2
from numbers

### 2) You will need to create SELECT statement in conjunction with LIKE.

Please list people which have first_name with at least 6 character long

names table schema
id
first_name
last_name
results table schema
first_name
last_name

SOLUTION: SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM names
WHERE first_name LIKE '______%'
